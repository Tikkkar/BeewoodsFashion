**Mitigation:** Start with proven chatbot, add agents incrementally based on demand

**Risk:** Facebook/Google changes API policies
**Mitigation:** Multi-platform strategy, direct relationships with platforms, diversify

## Business Risks
**Risk:** Can't hire fast enough
**Mitigation:** Use AI agents to scale without hiring, contract workers, strong employer brand

**Risk:** Cash flow issues
**Mitigation:** Annual billing discounts, maintain 6-month runway, profitable unit economics

**Risk:** Customer churn spike
**Mitigation:** Proactive CS agent, regular check-ins, value delivery tracking, quick response
